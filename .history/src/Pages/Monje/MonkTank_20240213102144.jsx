//  Damage Smoothing
// This stat priority is best for less experience players, and those who aregoing up against very hard-hitting bosses. It minimises the effect of personalmistakes by passively reducing burst damage taken.

// Expertise Rating (until 15%) and Hit Rating (until 7.5%);
// Mastery Rating;
// Agility;
// Critical Strike Rating;
// Haste Rating (between 4,000 and 11,000, depending on personalpreference).
// 1.2. Avoidance/DPS
// This priority emphasises Critical Strike Rating, which increases yourElusive Brew Icon Elusive Brew uptime. Avoidance gearing will reduce your total damagetaken the most, but it is not very reliable, and it makes you vulnerable tounpredictable spikes of damage. This is best suited for 10-man raiding.
